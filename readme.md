# Lightweight HTML5-based slideshow

This fork will try to add coordinated display of a slideshow across multiple browser sessions and the ability to jump particular pages by keyboard shortcut.

I will be also attempting (probably in a seperate project) to create slidewhows from OpenSong Files maybe using XSLT.

# Original Readme

This is a mini web app for people who'd rather build slides with HTML and CSS than with PowerPoint. See the example slideshow.html for instructions.
